## Objective
In this workshop, you will first build a 'production' web server environment on the actual virtual machine. You will then take those same steps and replicate them in a Dockerfile for building a containerized version of your VM.

The steps in this workshop are not extremely tedious. However, they are broken out into individual pages for a couple of reasons. First, it is to simplify the process and aid you in your comprehension. Second, it is for the purpose of you seeing the actual steps of building the production virtual machine so that you comprehend what you are doing as you add each step to the Dockerfile.
